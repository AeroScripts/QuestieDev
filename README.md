## Installation instructions:

### Download

In order to properly set up Questie with your World of Warcraft client, you must ensure you have the following:

* A Vanilla (1.12.1) WoW Client.
* Questie itself.
  * You can download the latest stable release from [here](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/releases/latest).
  * If you want to test the current status of development, you can download the full repository by clicking [this link](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/archive/master.zip).
    * Note that you have to copy the `!Questie` folder over to WoW, not the whole folder called `QuestieDev-master`.
    * There might be bugs.

### Setup

When you have both ready:

 - Extract the downloaded zip archive.
 - Copy the `!Questie` directory into your `<WOW PATH>/Interface/AddOns/` directory.
    * **NOTE: The default program folders in Windows (*C:\Program Files* or *C:\Program Files (x86)*) are write protected. DO NOT INSTALL WOW THERE. If it is installed there, move it to some other folder.** Questie and other addons do not work correctly when WoW is installed there.
 - Verify that Questie is loading and grant more addon memory
    - Start WoW
    - Log in
    - Go into the addon menu (button on the bottom left of the screen)
        - If there is no button or Questie is not in the list when the menu is opened, there might have been a mistake when copying Questie to the WoW directory
    - **Remove or increase the addon memory limit (top right of the addon menu window)**
        - Set to 0 for unlimited memory
        - Set no less than 256MB if you want to limit it, or WoW might crash
