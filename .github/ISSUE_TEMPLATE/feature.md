Hello, thanks for taking the time to create a feature request!

Before you proceed, please verify that you're running the latest version of Questie. The easiest way to do this is via the Twitch client, but you can also download the latest version here: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie
Moreover you should search the existing issues to check that no other user already asked for this new feature.

Questie is one of the most popular Classic WoW addons, with over 15M downloads. However, like almost all WoW addons, it's built and maintained by a team of volunteers. The current Questie team is:

* @BreakBB / TheCrux#1702 (Discord) - Development
* @drejjmit / Drejjmit#8241 (Discord) - Testing/Research
